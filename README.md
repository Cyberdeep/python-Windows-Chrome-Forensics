#This tool will create a folder on your USB called Chrome Dump and the files will be saved there.
#Please reach me for issues and or ideas to help you further
#Python source code is listed if you wish to compile it using Pyinstaller
#I have uploaded compiled EXE using pyinstaller which you can save to USB
#You will need to copy the Chrome folder from suspect PC to your USB if you are prohibited to placed saved EXE to suspect PC due to ingetrity. The Chrome folder is located in C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Google
#You may need to modify source code in this event as location directories are pointed on local machine path. I am working on updating a fix soon so user can select if running on target machine or straight from USB.
